# 🚀 Predictive Text Analysis for Science Exams 🚀

Welcome to our Predictive Text Analysis project! This repository contains code for predicting answers to science exam questions using advanced natural language processing techniques.

## 📚 Dataset Used

We utilized a comprehensive dataset containing questions (prompt) and answer choices (A, B, C, D, E) from science exams. The dataset was meticulously curated to ensure diverse and meaningful questions for analysis.

## 🔍 Features

- **Prompt Analysis**: We performed in-depth analysis on question prompts, exploring word frequencies, lengths, and semantic patterns.
- **Text Vectorization**: Utilized TF-IDF vectorization to convert textual data into numerical features for machine learning model training.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Implemented a Random Forest Classifier for answer prediction, achieving high accuracy on the test set.

## 🧠 Model Architecture

Our machine learning model comprises a Random Forest Classifier, a robust algorithm for multi-class classification tasks. We used TF-IDF vectorized features as input, enabling the model to learn complex patterns in the textual data.

## 🌟 Features

- **Interactive Visualizations**: Explore interactive charts and visualizations, including bar charts representing class distributions and dynamic word clouds showcasing frequently occurring words in questions.
- **3D Scatter Plots**: Dive into 3D scatter plots to uncover correlations between question difficulty, length, and correct answer frequencies.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Visualize the model's performance through an intuitive confusion matrix, providing insights into prediction accuracy.

## 🚀 Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Explore Jupyter Notebooks for in-depth data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis.
2. **Model Training**: Utilize the provided Python scripts to train the Random Forest Classifier and obtain predictions.
3. **Interactive Visualizations**: Run interactive Python scripts for dynamic visualizations of the dataset and model performance.
